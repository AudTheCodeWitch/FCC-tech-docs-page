				<header>Introduction</header>
				<p>Ruby is an object-oriented programming language, designed to make programmers happy.
				It has a lot of syntactic sugar that makes Ruby easy to read and fun to learn!</p>
				<p>I'm no technical writer (I'll leave that to my husband,
					<a href="https://twitter.com/docswarlock">@docswarlock</a>),
					but let me give you a quick rundown of some Ruby basics.
				</p>

			<section class="main-section" id="comments">
				<header>Comments</header>
				<p>
					There are two ways to comment your code in Ruby.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Single-Line:
						<br>
						<code>
							# A single-line comment begins with a hashtag.
						</code>
					</li>
					<li>Multi-Line:
						<br>
						<code>
							=begin<br>
							Multi-line comments<br>
							are nested between =begin and =end<br>
							=end
						</code>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Add comments to explain your code to other readers (including your future self.
					It's also helpful to note that commented code will not be executed.
				</p>

			<section class="main-section" id="variables">
				<header>Variables</header>
				<p>
					We use variables to store and retrieve data.
					Think back to your high school algebra class.
					Ruby variables work in much the same way.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ruby variables are declared using the assignment operator, also known as the equal sign (=).
					The variable name goes to the left, and the value is placed on the right.
				</p>
				<code>
					# the variable, x, equals the value, 1234.<br>
					x = 1234
				</code>
				<p>
					If you need to declare a constant, simply begin your variable name with a capital letter.
					It is common convention to use all caps for constants.
				</p>
				<code>
					Constant = "I'm a constant."<br>
					BETTERCONSTANT = "I'm a constant that follows conventions."
				</code>

			<section class="main-section" id="methods">
				<header>Methods</header>
				<p>
					Ruby methods, similar to functions in other languages, let you reuse chunks of code.
					Once you define a method, you can call it in other areas of your program!
				</p>
				<p>
					To define a method, use the keyword <code>def</code>, followed by the method's name.
					It is good practice to name your method in a way that describes its purpose.
					Close the method definition with the keyword <code>end</code>.
				</p>
				<code>
					def say_hello<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;puts "Hello World"<br>
					end
				</code>
				<p>
					To invoke a method, simply say the method's name.
				</p>
				<code>
					# Let's invoke our previous method.<br>
					say_hello<br>
					=> "Hello World"
				</code>
